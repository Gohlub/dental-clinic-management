# Dental Clinic Management System
This was a final project for my IB Computer Science Higher Level course. The objective was depyloy Systems development life cycle methodology of developing software. My solution was an application that would encapsulate all the different needs of my client (who was a newly-graduated dental medicine student). I developed a dental clinic management GUI system that encompassed the different record-keeping task of the future clinic along with some further extensions (an appointment setter and a invoice maker).

The documentation is structured by the instruction of the IB and should someone try to run it, my advice would be to download the whole project and use the .htm file as navigation across the project (it is like a cover-sheet)

I would love to hear feedback and possible extensions/improvements!
